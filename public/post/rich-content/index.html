<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">Wood transportation costs have significant impacts on timber investment returns. 
To optimize transportation costs, a practical design of the route network is 
necessary for log-trucks that ship wood material from timberlands to wood mills. 
Road conditions resulting from various road maintenance policies dramatically 
affect speed limits, log truck route networks, and transportation costs. 
By considering forest-road maintenance policies, this study intends to provide 
accurate information on timber-processing service coverage and log truck route 
selections for forest companies or subcontracted fleets of log trucks. 
This research also conducts the environmental analysis to assess the effects of
various road maintenance policies on consumed energy and greenhouse gas emissions of 
log trucks. With current maintenance policies, the results indicate that only between
33% and 51% of timber areas in Oregon can be accessed or harvested by existing nearby
wood mills. However, with the proposed road maintenance policy in this paper, 
accessibility to timberlands increases by up 18 to 104%. The cost of log 
transportation also decreases by 16% to 34%.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="data-and-methodology">Data and Methodology</h2>
<p>This section introduces data resources used for GIS analysis. It also explains the research framework developed to assess the effects of road maintenance policies. The data classification, quantification, and analysis were subdivided into seven steps <a href="#Fig.1">Fig. 1</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) Quantify the study area including forest area and a complete transportation network.</li>
<li>b) Quantify and classify the main network analysis elements including a complete transportation network, timber area, and wood mill locations according to geometric parameters.</li>
<li>c) Classify the methodology based on three scenarios.</li>
<li>d) Select and then quantify routes based on geospatial analysis, including optimized route selection, route travel time, travel distance, and service coverage calculations.</li>
<li>e) Conduct travel time analysis for three scenarios. * Conduct total transportation cost analysis for three scenarios including both user costs and agency costs.</li>
<li>f) Conduct energy consumption and environmental impact analysis for three scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will explain just couple of above steps and GIS-related works. Please refere to our publication <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/JTEPBS.0000335">here</a> fot details.</p>

<h3 id="study-area-step-a">Study area (Step a):</h3>
<p>The state of Oregon is the case study considered in this paper because of its large logging industry, huge forested areas, and extensive network of forest roads. The authors first filtered timber (harvesting) areas out from the overall 30 million acres of forests, resulting in 3.3 million acres of timber areas which is explained in more detail in the next section. In this study, 189 Oregon wood mills are considered. The road network between timberlands and wood mills include about 8,987.51 miles of highways including total state highway system miles, interstate miles, and some other state mileage such as state forests miles, and 408,007 miles of forest roads. This road network was generated by merging the Oregon highway and forest road networks in the next step <a href="#Fig.2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p><a name="GIS_database"></a></p>
<h3 id="gis-database-step-b">GIS database (Step b)</h3>
<p>In this study, several spatial databases including merged forest and highway road networks, and timberland areas including timber spots were used to complete GIS analysis and select routes with minimum travel time between timberlands and wood mills. Topographic maps, forest management maps, and timber locations were generated and analyzed in <a href="https://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/spring12articles/introducing-arcgis-101.html">ArcGIS10.1</a>. To collect required GIS data, boundaries and counties with the geographic coordinate system of “GCS North America 1983” were obtained from the <a href="http://spatialdata.oregonexplorer">Oregon Spatial Data Library website</a>. The forest layer for the State of Oregon was obtained from the Forest Service, an agency of the <a href="http://data.fs.usda.gov">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. This GIS layer provides valuable data and information regarding the usage of different forest areas in Oregon. There are total 30-million-acre forest and each area is assigned a function by the Forest Service to indicate if the forest area is allowed for timber cutting or not. Based on such information, about 3.3 million acres of area suitable for timber production, named harvesting areas, is identified for this study. In terms of wood mills, the authors collected data related to all western U.S. sawmills from the <a href="http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov">USDA website</a>. These data specify mills that only purchase logs or chips. These mills exclude paper or any other wood products that require secondary processing or rely entirely on recycled fiber. The data on roads (forest roads and highways) that connect different forest areas and mills were collected from <a href="http://data.fs.usda.gov">national forest-system roads</a> and the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">Oregon highway network.</a></p>
<p><a name="main"></a></p>
<h3 id="road-maintenance-scenarios-step-c">Road Maintenance Scenarios (Step c)</h3>
<p>The three
maintenance policies in the research are based on the road maintenance
classifications defined by USDA. Forest roads are classified
into five categories based on USDA’s five maintenance levels,
which reflect the road conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 roads are inactivated and managed as stored or closed
for more than 1 year.</li>
<li>Level 2 roads are suitable for high clearance vehicles and are not
maintained for passenger cars.</li>
<li>Level 3 roads are maintained for passenger cars. Roads are
typically low speed and single lane.</li>
<li>Level 4 roads are maintained for passenger cars and provide a
moderate degree of user comfort and convenience. Roads are
double lane and aggregate surfaced.</li>
<li>Level 5 roads are maintained for passenger cars and provide a
high degree of user comfort and convenience. Roads are normally
double lane.</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios were analyzed separately to (1) determine
the routes that provide the shortest travel time between
timberlands and wood mills, (2) estimate forest area service coverage,
and (3) calculate log transportation costs and, finally, carbon
emissions and fuel consumption of log trucks. The three maintenance
scenarios (policies) are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: Operational maintenance policy. According to this
scenario, all forest roads are maintained with respect to the current
maintenance levels (OMLs) specified by the USDA.</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Objective maintenance policy. According to this
scenario, all forest roads are maintained with respect to the desired
level of maintenance (ObMLs) specified by the USDA.</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Rehabilitation policy. In this scenario, it is assumed
that all forest road conditions were improved by maintenance and
rehabilitations with respect to their OML and ObML. For instance,
if the OML of a road is currently designated as being Level 2
and USDA defined Level 3 as the road’s ObML, then Level 3 is
considered to be the road condition improvement goal for the
numerical analysis in this paper.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="road"></a></p>
<h3 id="road-network-analysis-step-d">Road Network Analysis (Step d)</h3>
<p>The final road network was scaled as 2.54 cm (1 in.) is equal to
76.2 km (47.35 mi) on scaled topographic maps. The travel time
of a log truck for each road section was estimated and added to the
attribute table of the GIS road network database as a new field. The
travel time for each road segment was computed based on road segment
length and its assigned speed limit according to the section
“Road Maintenance Scenarios and Speed Limits (Step c).”
Network analysis is widely used in solving transportation problems
that usually include various parameter values, such as length,
cost, and travel time assigned to the network links. The optimal
path (usually shortest) is selected by searching the route and minimizing
the sum of the total link parameter values.
To employ real-world transportation data, this paper considered
one-way restrictions, turn restrictions, junction impedance, and
side-of-street constraints while minimizing a user-specified cost
attribute (travel time) for route networks. From different techniques
available in estimating the shortest path, the new <code>closet facility method</code>, a <code>Network Analyst</code> extension of <code>ArcGIS tools</code>, was used for each scenario separately to estimate the fastest
routes between wood mills and timber spots. The fastest route was
calculated by ArcGIS network analysis based on <code>Dijkstra’s algorithm</code> Some road segments might be
closed because their maintenance level is identified as Level 1.
Hence, their associated links were hypothetically excluded from
the network system by placing barriers on those links (bold lines
in <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a> map extent).
The service coverage for each road maintenance scenario
(policy) is defined as the number of wood mills assigned to
timber locations within each timber area (district). For instance,
the zoomed area in <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a> shows that only 2.7% of all wood mills
were assigned to the timber locations in the timber area named
Chiloquin Ranger District. In this research, the authors assume that
each wood mill can only serve one timber location or area, but one
timber location can be served by multiple wood mills.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a> illustrates the routing results (paths with shortest travel
time) for the first road maintenance scenario (OML policy). The
red lines in the smaller map demonstrate an example of closed forest
roads (OML= 1) resulting from the operational maintenance policy.
<a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a> shows the routable network including both highway and forestry
roads. The blue lines on the map are the resulting fastest routes
connecting the nearest timber harvesting areas (green circle) to each
wood mill (brown pentagon) under the first scenario. Note that a
route with a thicker line has a longer travel time. The maximum
travel time is about 987 min for travel between the Wild Rivers
Ranger District and Rough and Ready Lumber Company. The average
travel time of all routes with the shortest travel times in the first
scenario (OML policy) is 96.70 min (Table 3). The size of the green
circles indicates the number of mills supplied by each timber area.
The timber area allocated to the maximum number of mills is the
Clackamas River Ranger District with 42 assigned wood mills,
which is about 23% of the total mills. Furthermore, on average,
9.2 (4.86% of total mills) mills are supplied by each timber area,
while 49% of harvesting areas are inaccessible to all of the wood
mills.</p>
<p><a name="Fig.4"></a>
Figure 4: Routing solution of objective maintenance policy (Scenario II). Map generated using ArcGIS software.
<a href="/images/Figure4.png"><img src="/images/Figure4.png" alt="drawing" title="Klick to see Larger Scale!" width="700"/></a></p>
<p><a href="#Fig.4">Fig.4</a> and <a href="#Fig.5">Fig.5</a> indicate the results for objective maintenance policy
(Scenario 2) and rehabilitation policy (Scenario 3), respectively. The
average travel time is 97.490 min for Scenario 2, which is about the
same as Scenario 1. However, travel time is reduced to 65.893 min
for Scenario 3. For each timber area, the average number of assigned
service mills is 9.63 for Scenario 2, which is again about the same as 
Scenario 1, which had 9.2 mills. However, the number of mills is reduced significantly to 6.93 for Scenario 3. Note that even though the average number of mills is about the
same for Scenarios 1 and 2, the percentage of assigned mills can
be dramatically different for a specific timber area. For instance,
fewer mills (0.54% of mills) will be able to meet the demand for
McKenzie River Ranger District under the first scenario. However,
this percentage increased dramatically to 41.53% under the second
scenario. This means that as neighboring mills become inaccessible
to the district, more distant mills will be selected to partially meet
the demands of the district. This is because more forest roads will be
closed to traffic under the objective maintenance policy compared to operational maintenance policy, which will result in more mills being inaccessible from neighboring districts. Thus, mills far from
the district have to be selected to serve the district. In total, 67% of
timber harvest areas became inaccessible to wood mills under the
second scenario compared to 49% in the first scenario.</p>
