Project Abstract Highway-rail grade crossings (HRGCs) are where a roadway and railway intersect at the same level.Safety at HRGCs has been identified as a high-priority concern among transportation agencies, but there has been little research on the effects of HRGC geometric parameters on their safety performance.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Project Abstract Data Methodology  
Project Abstract In this project, I executed several python scripts and GIS models to allow map-matching of more than 14,000 bike GPS points to the Downtown Toronto street network. These data are using as part of the project titled &amp;#34;Bike route choice modeling analysis&amp;#34;.  
Data The GPS points in this project indicate several number of specific routes which are passed by several number of bike riders.</description>
