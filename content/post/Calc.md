## Explanations:
HRGC geometric effect calculator is an application designed to predict crash occurrence and severity likelihood changes over 30 years. The calculator works based on the Competing Risk Models which is one of the survival analysis approach and it is counted as a novel model in transportation safety analysis. Please refer [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105470) for more details about the model.
Through this online application, you can change the geometrics characteristics of the highway-rail grade crossing and see the change effect on crash occurrence and severity changes over 30 years in interactive plots.
### Note: Except geometric contributors (which you can modify them), all the other contributors are controlled at a fixed level, mode value.
