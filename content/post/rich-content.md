## Project Abstract 
{{< highlight html >}}
Wood transportation costs have significant impacts on timber investment returns. 
To optimize transportation costs, a practical design of the route network is 
necessary for log-trucks that ship wood material from timberlands to wood mills. 
Road conditions resulting from various road maintenance policies dramatically 
affect speed limits, log truck route networks, and transportation costs. 
By considering forest-road maintenance policies, this study intends to provide 
accurate information on timber-processing service coverage and log truck route 
selections for forest companies or subcontracted fleets of log trucks. 
This research also conducts the environmental analysis to assess the effects of
various road maintenance policies on consumed energy and greenhouse gas emissions of 
log trucks. With current maintenance policies, the results indicate that only between
33% and 51% of timber areas in Oregon can be accessed or harvested by existing nearby
wood mills. However, with the proposed road maintenance policy in this paper, 
accessibility to timberlands increases by up 18 to 104%. The cost of log 
transportation also decreases by 16% to 34%.

## Data and Methodology 
This section introduces data resources used for GIS analysis. It also explains the research framework developed to assess the effects of road maintenance policies. The data classification, quantification, and analysis were subdivided into seven steps [Fig. 1](#Fig.1): 
* A) Quantify the study area including forest area and a complete transportation network. 
* b) Quantify and classify the main network analysis elements including a complete transportation network, timber area, and wood mill locations according to geometric parameters. 
* c) Classify the methodology based on three scenarios. 
* d) Select and then quantify routes based on geospatial analysis, including optimized route selection, route travel time, travel distance, and service coverage calculations. 
* e) Conduct travel time analysis for three scenarios. * Conduct total transportation cost analysis for three scenarios including both user costs and agency costs. 
* f) Conduct energy consumption and environmental impact analysis for three scenarios.

In the following, I will explain just couple of above steps and GIS-related works. Please refere to our publication [here](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/JTEPBS.0000335) fot details.

### Study area (Step a):
The state of Oregon is the case study considered in this paper because of its large logging industry, huge forested areas, and extensive network of forest roads. The authors first filtered timber (harvesting) areas out from the overall 30 million acres of forests, resulting in 3.3 million acres of timber areas which is explained in more detail in the next section. In this study, 189 Oregon wood mills are considered. The road network between timberlands and wood mills include about 8,987.51 miles of highways including total state highway system miles, interstate miles, and some other state mileage such as state forests miles, and 408,007 miles of forest roads. This road network was generated by merging the Oregon highway and forest road networks in the next step [Fig. 2](#Fig.2).
